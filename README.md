# Hyprland Base Configuration  

This repository contains my **initial and base Hyprland setup**. It serves as a foundation for my personalized configurations across multiple devices.  

## **Structure**  
- The **main branch** contains the base configuration that works as a starting point.  
- Each **branch** corresponds to a specific computer, with customizations tailored for that machine.  

## **Installation**  

To set up this configuration on your system, run the following:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the0remora/hyprland-config.git ~/.config/hyprland-config
cd ~/.config/hyprland-config
bash install.sh
